# Choice Net

__[Link to the app](https://choice-net-git-main-ricardofrancoli.vercel.app/)__

Choice Net is a simple quiz app with a net of 3 different outcomes depending on your answers.

Each question will have 4 different answers with different points that add to a tally:

* __2 Points:__ Adds 2 points and jumps _one_ question
* __1 Point:__ Adds 1 point and jumps _two_ questions
* __0 Points:__ Doesn't add any points and exits the test straight away

For the outcomes:
* __Total Points < 4:__ Outcome 1
* __Total Points >= 4 and <= 7:__ Outcome 2
* __Total Points > 7:__ Outcome 3

The app was developed using React, Material UI and react-transition-group.

I hope you like it! :)
